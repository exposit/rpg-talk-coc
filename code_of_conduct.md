# Code of Conduct

1. Foster a safe and respectful environment** for all participants. ` 1a.`**Respect includes acknowledging other people’s boundaries.** If they ask for you to stop a conversation about a topic, you must respect their request. We place very high value on people’s conversational boundaries, which means that it’s highly important to halt, pause or redirect conversations on request.

2. **Treat everyone with respect.** Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value. 

   1. **Hateful ideologies and/or behaviors are not welcome** in our community. This includes abuse, harassment, frivolous and false accusations, and discrimination (particularly on the basis of race, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, or physical or mental ability). ` 
   2. **Protect the marginalized.** When it comes to speaking on RPG Talk, we expect you not to “punch down” against folks who are struggling. They need your support and we aim to provide it.

3. **Discuss, don't argue.** Appreciate varied opinions and communicate in an attempt to understand. Avoid making blanket statements. Do not argue just for the sake of arguing or winning an argument.

4. Follow our **rules on promotion,** here: https://rpg-talk.com/rules_for_promotion.pdf In summary: 

   1. Keep your promotion out of #general. 
   2. Limit your promotions to no more than once per week.
   3. Provide links or large promotional posts in only a single channel

5. **Respect people's game choices and experiences.** Making accusations of people playing badly or incorrectly isn't helpful.

6. **Work to maintain a mutual understanding** rather than making assumptions. Not everyone has the same context. Be careful not to treat your opinions or experiences as superior to others’.

7. **Don’t troll,** harass or publicly shame others.

8. **Don’t encourage or engage in piracy.** Discord's anti-piracy rules mean the server is at risk from its member's behavior. For simplicity this means...

   1. Do post: storefronts, creator webpages, creator posts sharing their content (on blogs, reddit, twitter or forums, etc)
   2. Do not post: Anonymous archive hosting, chan boards, direct links to PDFs, directly upload PDFs

9. **Acknowledge and respect the intersection between RPGs and Politics.** RPGs, like all things people create, are political to their very core. On RPG Talk we want to support the ability to talk about the problematic history, their effects on the marginalized and encourage the hobby to move forward to better places. 

   **However,** this must happen within the framework of the rules. If your politics don’t respect another person’s identity, then you may not discuss your politics. If you are trying to argue to win rather than to understand, you may not discuss your politics. When discussing politics, respecting other people and their boundaries is more important than usual. 

## Further Topics

**As moderators, we believe that merely banning political speech results in a place where the marginalized lose their voices and the status quo remains. That that’s not what we want.** Rule 9 exists because our original method of diverting politics to #deleted-channel, a channel for tough topics, created a den of strong, hostile opinions that made it tough for moderators. This is why we’re reframing our rules to allow political speech everywhere as long as it’s topical and within the bounds of our rules. We expect that non-game related political conversations are limited and done with great restraint and respect. Since RPG Talk is about games, political speech not relating to RPGs (such as election politics) will be held to a much higher standard than, say, a discussion about the problematic nature of H.P. Lovecraft and how to make games based off of his work inclusive. No matter how you feel about politics, you must respect all our rules.

**Minimize NSFW material, news/politics links and use content warnings.** We aim for an environment that is safe for a professional workspace. If you must post something that is NSFW or may bother others, surround links with <> characters like `<https://www.google.com/>` to suppress the image preview and/or double bars, which hides the text as a spoiler. Use a concise content warnings before the spoiler-barred text such as “CW: topic“.

**Behavior outside of RPG Talk can affect us here.** We would love for RPG Talk to exist in a vacuum away from the rest of the internet, but it does not. If something off-site  violates our Code of Conduct,we will take it into consideration, particularly if it is affecting the cohesion of the community. We'd really prefer not to have to deal with this and we have no intention to actively police conduct elsewhere.
